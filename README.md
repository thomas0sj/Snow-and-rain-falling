# Snow-and-rain-falling
You can click on four buttons. One makes snow fall, another rain fall and the two left are light and dark mode.
The project is unfinished as you can make snow and rain fall at the same time but since you cannot kill a function outside of it, the only solution I see would be to make the function run for 20 seconds and then stop it.
